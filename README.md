# JSONBeautifier

JSONBeautifier is a Chrome extension used for beautifing JSON code on the go. All you have to do is click the extension, and your code is highlighted and simplyified.

NOTE: The extension will only beautify code by getting the JSON code from the first &lt;pre&gt; element and replacing the whole page with the neater JSON code. The extension works best on pages where only JSON content is loaded.
